# Adept Secret Sharing (ADSS)

An example implementation of adept secret sharing (ADSS) as described by
Bellare, Dai and Rogaway.

## Security

This is a work-in-progress implementation and should not be used in any
production systems. It _does not_ currently match the paper so it does not
provide many of the guarantees required by ADSS. It has also received no
security reviews so it should not be trusted until it has.
